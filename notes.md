Changes: 

Created a facebook-styles-light CSS declaration and gave it background, border, and color and styled its hover and active with border-color and background. 

## Important Note:

Remember that the goal here is not to copy the specific CSS rules that the coder in the video makes but it is to learn how to organize our CSS file, style different states of an element and learn the properties that make up a good fancy button. 

### Error

I forgot the x for the facebook-styles-btn so the padding is not complete
